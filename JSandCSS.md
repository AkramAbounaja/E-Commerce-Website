    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the navigation horizontal by using display: inline; within nav ul li<br>{ }. display: inline allowed all of the text to fit into one<br>line rather than the split lines like it was before.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I gave the navigation a background by using background-color with an rgb value<br>within nav ul { } in style. It gave the rgb value I<br>specified.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the links change color on mouseover by using a:hover to target<br>the &lt;a&gt; tags which contain the links.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (âœ“)</td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased<br>by using text-transform: uppercase while focusing on the first letter of h1 and<br>a by using h1::first-letter and a::firstletter.<div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The custom styling of my choice is making the intitial text aqua using<br>color:aqua. I also made it so when the link is focused (by clicking<br>on it) it turns red and stays red until you click on something<br>else. It works because those commands in HTML allows it to do those<br>things I specified.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The styling for the challenge list does not impact the navigation list because<br>when making the style edits, I specified where I wanted the edits to<br>be. For example, nav ul li { } allowed all the edits within<br>the { } to be with items that share all those tags.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned many things such as how to stylize different aspects in html<br>with all the attribute names that you need to know. I also learned<br>CSS when capitalizing the first letters. A difficulty I had was getting the<br>h1 tag and title tag to change when clicking on a link. I<br>attempted to solve it by testing out different ways I researched about trying<br>to grab the current clicked on link such as getElementbyID or tag and<br>those different ones but I was unsuccessful.<br></p><br></td></tr>
