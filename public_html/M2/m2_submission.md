<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I solved the problem by using a foreach loop which is an easy<br>way to traverse over arrays. The loop traverses over the array $arr and<br>assigns each value to a key $x. $x is then compared in an<br>if statement to see if the remainder when dividing it by 2 is<br>not 0. If this is true, that means the value is odd and<br>then it is echod out. if not, the foreach loop continues without outputting<br>anything because the value was positive.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Describe how you solved the problem</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I solved the problem by using a foreach loop similarly to problem 1<br>because it allows me to traverse over arrays easily. While traversing over the<br>array, I added the value to a total value that was established outside<br>of the loop. Once the loop is completed, the rounding is done with<br>the number_format() function which allowed me to round to 2 decimal places while<br>also keeping the trailing 0 when the total was 0.10 (var_export did not<br>keep the trailing 0). An edit of commenting out var_export and echoing the<br>$total done by number_format without concatenation was done to get it to display<br>correctly for 0.10.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The positive conversion was done in this problem by using a foreach loop<br>to loop through all the values in the array. For every value, the<br>loop checks if it is less than 0 (which means it is negative),<br>and if it is, to echo out the value multiplied by -1 (to<br>make the value positive.) If the value is not negative, the loop goes<br>to the else statement which echoes out the unchanged value because the value<br>is already positive. By using var_dump, i checked the data types and the<br>data types all stay the same by the end of the for loop.<br>The first two arrays are int, the 3rd array is float and the<br>last array is string. All of them were able to be changed to<br>their positive values no matter the data type they were. For example, for<br>the strings, they were able to be multiplied by -1 succesfully. This is<br>because php provides automatic data type conversion and will convert the strings into<br>an integer.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Talk about what you learned, any issues you had, how you resolve them</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned many things in this assignment. First, I learned how to use<br>the foreach loop that we learned about. I implemented it in all three<br>of the problems to be used. I also learned about the function number_format()<br>which can be used in different situations, but I used it in this<br>situation to round the number to 2 decimal places. I learned that as<br>a result of one of the issues I had which was that one<br>of the results in problem 2 were not displaying in 2 decimal places<br>because one of them had a trailing 0. var_export seemed to ignore the<br>trailing decimal place but number_format didn&#39;t. I learned that var_export returns string representations<br>of variables. I also learned how to manually deploy things from homework assignments<br>onto Heroku for the code that we create to be displayed on the<br>website.<br></p><br></td></tr>
